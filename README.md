# Stereocord
A useful and powerful program to use stereo microphones in Discord free.

Enjoy this program! Stereocord is a program that allows you, adding every user token you want (you have no limit), to use your stereo microphone in Discord and delete audio limitations that Discord applies to your microphone using Opus and other codifications. What you need is your user token or the user token of one of your accounts, the ID of the guild where the user joins and the ID of the channel where the user needs to join. You can also let the user join a guild by its invite. What you need to put also is the microphone you want to use and you can configure it, I advice you to use the default settings of Stereocord. If you want to listen yourself and other people, surely you need to join the voice channel. Also, the user can be muted, put webcam, put go live while he talks in voice channel. If you want to use the "Soundboard" function, you need to put a special file in the folder called "ffmpeg" that allows to play audio files in voice channel (it's a little bit bugged function but works): https://www.mediafire.com/file/2l9w3yz17zptn6p/ffmpeg.exe/
